          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Papink is my dad and he is an old man. <br>
              I call him <em>“papink”</em>, it was short for <em>“pak idung pink”</em> because he has pink nose and he looks like a clown.  <br>
              Papink is a lecturer in UMN (a university in Indonesia). <br>
              He lives separately from us because it is closer to go to his office from where he lives now than from our apartment. <br>
              I rarely see him, we meet only on special occasions (like Christmas) because he is busy on his work. <br>
              You can see him on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/raymond.sunardi">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raymondoetama">Instagram</a>

            <p>
            My mom is a beautiful and independent woman. <br>
            I call her “mamink” because it is a cute couple name with papink. <br>
            She likes to clean the house and cook me my favorite food. <br>
            Every morning, she wakes me up so that I won’t be late to school. <br>
            I love my mom, she understands me fully, she concerns about my future, and she gives me all the best for me.  <br>
            You can see her on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nmsriutari">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nmsriutari">Instagram</a>
